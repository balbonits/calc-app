## Grok Project Plan Addition

**Simple Calculator (Next.js/TypeScript/Tailwind)**

**Product Overview**: A web-based calculator app for basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division).

**Target Audience**: Portfolio visitors at `https://www.jdilig.me/projects` to showcase modern web dev skills.

**Key Features**:
- **UI**: Numeric keypad (0-9), operators (+, -, *, /), clear button, equals button, and result display.
- **Functionality**: 
	- Input numbers and operators via button clicks.
	- Display current input and results in real-time.
	- Handle basic arithmetic calculations.
	- Clear display to reset.
- **Error Handling**: Prevent invalid inputs (e.g., multiple decimals, division by zero) with user-friendly error messages (e.g., "Error").
- **Responsive Design**: Usable on desktop and mobile with consistent layout.

**Tech Requirements**:
- **Next.js**: Use for component-based structure and potential static generation.
- **TypeScript**: Enforce type safety for state and event handlers.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Apply utility-first styling for rapid, responsive design (grid for buttons, flex for layout).

**User Stories**:
1. As a user, I want to input numbers and operators so I can perform calculations.
2. As a user, I want a clear button to reset the calculator.
3. As a user, I want to see results instantly after pressing equals.
4. As a user, I want error messages for invalid operations (e.g., division by zero).
5. As a user, I want the app to look good and work seamlessly on my phone or desktop.

**Design Guidelines**:
- Clean, minimal UI with readable fonts.
- Button grid layout (4x4 or similar) with hover effects.
- Display area for input/results (right-aligned text).
- Use Tailwind classes for styling (e.g., `bg-gray-200`, `hover:bg-gray-300`, `rounded`).
- Mobile-friendly with adaptive font sizes and spacing.

**Edge Cases**:
- Prevent multiple consecutive operators.
- Handle decimal points (only one per number).
- Display "Error" for invalid expressions or division by zero.

**Deliverables**:
- Single-page Next.js app with calculator component.
- Deployable to Vercel or similar for portfolio showcase.
- Include screenshot, description, and GitHub link on `https://www.jdilig.me/projects`.

**Estimated Effort**: 6-10 hours for development and testing.

**Portfolio Impact**: Highlights skills in Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind, and responsive UI design.

## Purpose
- Offer basic and advanced calculator features for everyday use.
- Serve as a showcase for Next.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS best practices.

## Tech Stack
- **Framework:** Next.js (App Router)
- **Language:** TypeScript
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS

## Core Features
- Basic arithmetic operations (add, subtract, multiply, divide)
- Responsive UI for desktop and mobile
- Clear, maintainable code structure
- (Optional) Advanced features: history, scientific functions, theme switching

## Initial Ideas
- Minimalist design with Tailwind CSS
- Organized codebase using Next.js App Router
- Focus on accessibility and usability
